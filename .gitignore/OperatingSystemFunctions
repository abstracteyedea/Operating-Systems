In operating systems, memory management is the function that manages the computers primary memory(RAM).
The memory management function keeps track of the status of allocated or 
free memory and determines how much of the memory is allocated throughout each task. 
The memory structure contains the volatile memory and secondary memory. Apps are stored in the secondary
memory, the hard dive of your computer. When you run an app, it moves to the main memory, the RAM of the system.
