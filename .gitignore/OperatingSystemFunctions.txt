In operating systems, memory management is the function that manages the computers primary memory(RAM). The memory management function keeps track of the status of allocated or free memory and determines how much of the memory is allocated throughout each task. The memory structure contains the volatile memory and secondary memory. Apps are stored in the secondary memory, the hard dive of your computer. When you run an app, it moves to the main memory, the RAM of the system.

Loading and executing are another part of operating systems in computer systems. The loader is responsible for loading programs and libraries and is essential in starting a program. It places the program into memory and prepares them for execution. Loading a program involves reading the content of a file with a program instructions into memory, and then carrying out other required task to be able to get the program up and running.

Operating system security is the function that ensures the OS integrity, confidentiality and availability. OS security pertains to the specific steps or measures used to protect the OS from threats, viruses, worms, malware, and hackers. OS security includes all preventative control techniques, which safeguards a computers assets from being stolen, edited or deleted if any OS security is compromised.
